## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - RELATING TWO NUMBERS

---

### AIM  
To Create a Python Program to  find the greatest of two numbers using lambda function.

---

### ALGORITHM


1. Begin the program.  
2. Use `eval()` to get two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) from the user.  
3. Define a lambda function `max` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`.  
4. The lambda function compares the numbers and prints:
   - If `x > y`, then it prints: "`num1` is greater than `num2`".
   - Otherwise, it prints: "`num2` is greater than `num1`".
5. Call the lambda function by passing `num1` and `num2` as arguments.  
6. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
REG NO. 212222220015
NAME:  HEMANTH BABU M B
Max = lambda a, b : a if(a > b) else b
 
input1=int(input())
input2=int(input())
print("The greatest number is:",Max(input1,input2))

```

### RESULT

```
Thus, the Python Program for finding the greatest of two numbers using lambda function is executed sucessfully.
